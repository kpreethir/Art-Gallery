      <h2 class="artist">Descrption:</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Having served in the second World War, Ellsworth Kelly took his
        observations of nature and architectural forms to mature his practice in
        experimental ways. Through a rigorous study of abstraction, his
        paintings and sculptures went on to develop Minimalism as a whole. The
        ‘Red Yellow Blue’ series affected the course of color-field painting and
        was created as Kelly began to “uncover the nearly infinite possibilities
        of monochrome, color spectrum, chance ordering, and multi-panel
        composition.” ‘Red Yellow Blue II’ is composed of seven panels, with a
        black panel in the center the divides yet joins the three panels on its
        either side. Two blue panels unify the sequence on both ends,
        underlining Kelly’s understanding of composition. This painting is the
        largest out of the works he made during his time in Paris and is
        considered to be one of his finest and most influential works on canvas.

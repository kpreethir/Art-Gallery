      <p class="description">
        Gerhard Richter was born in 1932 in the Weimar Republic. As a teenager,
        he left school to apprentice as a stage-set painter and later studied at
        the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. After fleeing to West Germany before
        the Berlin Wall was erected, he studied under Karl Otto Got. Eventually
        he became a professor for several years before he moved to Cologne in
        1983 where he still lives and continues to work. Throughout his life, he
        has declined many private commissions, preferring to be very particular
        as to which deals he chooses. In addition to his photo-realistic style,
        Richter produced abstract works as well. His works exhibit illusionistic
        space and the material of painting. In these, he would paint cumulative
        layers on a photorealist image to distort it and create textured grey
        monochromes.
